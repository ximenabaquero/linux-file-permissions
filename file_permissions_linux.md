# File Permissions in Linux

## Project description
In this project, I managed file and directory permissions in a Linux environment to enforce access control and reduce unauthorized modifications. I used commands such as `ls -la` to inspect current permissions and `chmod` to configure them according to organizational policies. This activity demonstrates my ability to apply core cybersecurity practices in file systems.

## Check file and directory details

```bash
ls -la projects/
